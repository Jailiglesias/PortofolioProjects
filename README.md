### Project 1 - Analyze International Debt Statistics

**Description:** 

This is a project offered by DataCamp, in which I analyze things like: 

* What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?

* Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?

* What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
